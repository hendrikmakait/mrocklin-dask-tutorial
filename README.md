# Dask Tutorial

In this tutorial you will learn the basics of Dask, specifically the following:

1.  How to parallelize simple for-loop code with [Dask Futures](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/futures.html)
2.  How to scale up Pandas code with [Dask Dataframes](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/dataframes.html)

Additionally you will work on real large scale data using a cluster of machines on the cloud

## Set up

We have two options for you to follow this tutorial:

### Run locally

1. **Clone this repository**

    In your terminal:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mrocklin/dask-tutorial
    cd dask-tutorial
    ```

    Alternatively, you can download the zip file of the repository at the top of the main page of the repository. This is a good option if you don't have experience with git.

2. **Create Conda Environment**

    In your terminal navigate to the directory where you have cloned/downloaded the `dask-tutorial` repository and install the required packages:

    ```
    conda env create -f binder/environment.yml
    ```

    This will create a new environment called `dask-tutorial`. To activate the environment do:

    ```
    conda activate dask-tutorial
    ```

    Alternatively, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    This may or may not work as well.
    We recommened doing this from a fresh Python environment (this will make
    synchronizing with your cluster easier).

3. **Establish Coiled Access**

    This tutorial will use Dask clusters on the cloud.  We will get these
    clusters using a SaaS product, Coiled.  You can either ...

    1.  Sign up (it's free and there's no commitment) as follows:

        ```
        coiled login
        ```

        You'll be asked to authenticate with GitHub to make an account.  Don't
        worry about connecting to your cloud resources.  We'll add you to the
        `dask-tutorials` team, which is connected to an AWS account of ours.

        To get this access, ask to be added in the #dask-tutorial channel.

        Alternatively, you can also ...

    2.  Use a short-lived auth token

        ```
        coiled login --token 65924ef194cc4b658ff37c1c11caa357-2ad71e4ceeafd5a771f553306cff95eb9624ee2d --account dask-tutorials
        ```

        This should just work, but will expire in a few days and you won't be
        able to access the web view.

3. **Open Jupyter Lab**

    Once your environment has been activated and you are in the `dask-tutorial` repository, start Jupyter Lab:

    ```
    jupyter lab
    ```

    You will see a notebooks directory, click on there and you will be ready to go.

    *We recommend Jupyter Lab due to the [Dask Jupyter extension](https://github.com/dask/dask-labextension).*


### Run on a cloud notebook
